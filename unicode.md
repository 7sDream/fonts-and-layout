The Unicode Standard
====================

When humans exchange information, we use sentences, words, and - most relevantly for our purposes - letters. But computers don't know anything about letters. Computers only know about numbers, and to be honest, they don't know much about them, either. Because computers are, ultimately, great big collections of electronic switches, they only know about two numbers: zero, if a switch is off, and one, when a switch is on.

By lining up a row of switches, we can represent bigger numbers. These days, computers normally line up eight switches in a unit, called a *byte*. With eight switches and two states for each switch, we have $2^8 = 256$ possible states in a byte, so we can represent a number between 0 and 255. But still, everything is a number.

To move from numbers to letters and store text in a computer, we need to agree on a code. We might decide that when we're expecting text, the number 1 means "a", number 2 means "b" and so on. This mapping between numbers and characters is called an *encoding*.

In the earliest days of computers, every manufacturer had their own particular encoding, but they soon realised that data written on one system would not be able to be read on another. There was a need for computer and telecommunications manufacturers to standardize their encodings. One of the earliest and most common encodings was ASCII, the American Standard Code for Information Interchange. First standardized in 1963, this system uses seven of the eight bits (switches) in a byte, giving an available range of 128 characters.

In ASCII, the numbers from 0 to 31 represent "control characters". These do not represent printable information, but give instructions to the devices which use ASCII: start a new line, delete the previous character, start transmission, stop transmission and so on. 32 is a space, and the numbers from 33 to 64 are used to represent a range of non-alphabetic symbols, including the numerals 0 to 9. The numbers from 65 to 127 encode the 26 lower case and 26 upper case letters of the English alphabet, with some more non-alphabetic symbols squeezed in the gap.

But ASCII was, as its name implies, an *American* standard, and for most of the world, 26 lower case and 26 upper case letters is - to use something of a British understatement - not going to be enough. When Europeans needed to exchange data including accented characters, or Russians needed to write files in Cyrillic, or Greeks in Greek, the ASCII standard did not allow them to do so. But on the other hand, ASCII only used seven bits out of the byte, encoding the numbers from 0 to 127. And a byte can store any number from 0 to 255, leaving 127 free code points up for grabs.

The problem, of course, 127 code points was not enough for the West Europeans and the Russians and the Greeks to *all* encode all of the characters that they needed. So, as in the days of the Judges, all the people did whatever seemed right in their own eyes; every national language group developed their own encoding, jamming whatever characters that they needed into the upper half of the ASCII table. Suddenly, all of the interchange problems reappeared. Someone in France might send a message asking for a *tête-à-tête*, but his Russian colleague would be left wondering what a *tЙte-Ю-tЙte* might be. And it was worse than that: a Greek PC user might greet someone with a cheery Καλημέρα, but if his friend happened to be using a Mac, he would find himself being wished an ακγλίώα instead.

And then the Japanese arrived.

To write Japanese you need 100 syllabic characters and anything between 2,000 and 100,000 Chinese ideographs. Suddenly 127 free code points seems like a drop in the ocean. There are a number of ways that you can solve this problem, and different Japanese computer manufacturers tried all of them. The Shift JIS encoding used two bytes (16 bits, so 65536 different states) to represent each character; EUC-JP used a variable number of bytes, with the first byte telling you how many bytes in a character; ISO-2022-JP used magic "escape sequences" of characters to jump between ASCII and JIS. Files didn't always tell you what encoding they were using, and so it was a very common experience in Japan to open up a text file and be greeted with a screen full of mis-encoded gibberish. (The Japanese for "mis-encoded gibberish" is *mojibake*.)

Clearly there was a need for a new encoding; one with a broad enough scope to encode *all* the world's characters, and one which could unify the proliferation of local "standards" into a single, global information processing standard. That encoding is Unicode.
