title: The Unicode Standard

When humans exchange information, we use sentences, words, and - most relevantly for our purposes - letters. But computers don't know anything about letters. Computers only know about numbers, and to be honest, they don't know much about them, either. Because computers are, ultimately, great big collections of electronic switches, they only know about two numbers: zero, if a switch is off, and one, when a switch is on.

By lining up a row of switches, we can represent bigger numbers. These days, computers normally line up eight switches in a unit, called a *byte*. With eight switches and two states for each switch, we have $$ 2^8 = 256 $$ possible states in a byte, so we can represent a number between 0 and 255. But still, everything is a number.

To move from numbers to letters and store text in a computer, we need to agree on a code. We might decide that when we're expecting text, the number 1 means "a", number 2 means "b" and so on. This mapping between numbers and characters is called an *encoding*.

In the earliest days of computers, every manufacturer had their own particular encoding, but they soon realised that data written on one system would not be able to be read on another. There was a need for computer and telecommunications manufacturers to standardize their encodings. One of the earliest and most common encodings was ASCII, the American Standard Code for Information Interchange. First standardized in 1963, this system uses seven of the eight bits (switches) in a byte, giving an available range of 128 characters.

In ASCII, the numbers from 0 to 31 represent "control characters". These do not represent printable information, but give instructions to the devices which use ASCII: start a new line, delete the previous character, start transmission, stop transmission and so on. 32 is a space, and the numbers from 33 to 64 are used to represent a range of non-alphabetic symbols, including the numerals 0 to 9. The numbers from 65 to 127 encode the 26 lower case and 26 upper case letters of the English alphabet, with some more non-alphabetic symbols squeezed in the gap.

But ASCII was, as its name implies, an *American* standard, and for most of the world, 26 lower case and 26 upper case letters is - to use something of a British understatement - not going to be enough. When Europeans needed to exchange data including accented characters, or Russians needed to write files in Cyrillic, or Greeks in Greek, the ASCII standard did not allow them to do so. But on the other hand, ASCII only used seven bits out of the byte, encoding the numbers from 0 to 127. And a byte can store any number from 0 to 255, leaving 127 free code points up for grabs.

The problem, of course, is that 127 code points was not enough for the West Europeans and the Russians and the Greeks to *all* encode all of the characters that they needed. And so, as in the days of the Judges, all the people did whatever seemed right in their own eyes; every national language group developed their own encoding, jamming whatever characters that they needed into the upper half of the ASCII table. Suddenly, all of the interchange problems that ASCII was meant to solve reappeared. Someone in France might send a message asking for a *t√™te-√†-t√™te*, but his Russian colleague would be left wondering what a *t–ôte-–Æ-t–ôte* might be. But wait! It was worse than that: a Greek PC user might greet someone with a cheery ŒöŒ±ŒªŒ∑ŒºŒ≠œÅŒ±, but if his friend *happened to be using a Mac*, he would find himself¬†being wished an Œ±Œ∫Œ≥ŒªŒØœéŒ± instead.

And then the Japanese showed up.

To write Japanese you need 100 syllabic characters and anything between 2,000 and 100,000 Chinese ideographs. Suddenly 127 free code points seems like a drop in the ocean. There are a number of ways that you can solve this problem, and different Japanese computer manufacturers tried all of them. The Shift JIS encoding used two bytes (16 bits, so 65536 different states) to represent each character; EUC-JP used a variable number of bytes, with the first byte telling you how many bytes in a character; ISO-2022-JP used magic "escape sequences" of characters to jump between ASCII and JIS. Files didn't always tell you what encoding they were using, and so it was a very common experience in Japan to open up a text file and be greeted with a screen full of mis-encoded gibberish. (The Japanese for "mis-encoded gibberish" is *mojibake*.)

Clearly there was a need for a new encoding; one with a broad enough scope to encode *all* the world's characters, and one which could unify the proliferation of local "standards" into a single, global information processing standard. That encoding is Unicode.

## How data is stored

When computers store data in eight-bit bytes, representing numbers from 0 to 255, and your character set contains fewer than 255 characters, everything is easy. A character fits within a byte, so each byte in a file represents one character. One number maps to one letter, and you're done.

But when your character set has a potential 1,112,064 code points, you need a strategy for how you're going to store those code points in bytes of eight bits. This strategy is called a *character encoding*, and the Unicode Standard defines three of them: UTF-8, UTF-16 and UTF-32. (UTF stands for *Unicode Transformation Format*, because you're transforming code points into bytes and vice versa.)

> There are a number of other character encodings in use, which are not part of the Standard, such as UTF-7, UTF-EBCDIC and the Chinese Unicode encoding GB18030. If you need them, you'll know about it.

The names of the character encodings reflect the number of bits used in encoding. It's easiest to start with UTF-32: if you take a group of 32 bits, you have $2^32 = 4,294,967,296$ possible states, which is more than enough to represent every character that's ever likely to be in Unicode. Every character is represented as a group of 32 bits, stretched across four 8-bit bytes. To encode a code point in UTF-32, just turn it into binary, pad it out to four bytes, and you're done.

For example, the character üéÖ (FATHER CHRISTMAS) lives in Finland, just inside the Arctic circle, and in the Unicode Standard, at codepoint 127877. In binary, this is 11111001110001111, which we can encode in four bytes using UTF-32 as follows:

|---
| |
|-------|--------|--------:|--------:|--------:|
|Binary |         |       1|11110011|10001111|
|Padded | 00000000|00000001|11110011|10001111|
|Hex    |       00|      01|      F3|      85|
|Decimal|        0|       1|     243|     133|
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|


> There's only one slight complication: whether the bytes should appear in the order `00 01 F3 85` or in reverse order `85 F3 01 00`. By default UTF-32 stores data "big-end first" (`00 01 F3 85`) but some systems prefer to put the "little-end" first. They let you know that they're doing this by encoding a special character (ZERO WIDTH NO BREAKING SPACE) at the start of the file. How this character is encoded tells you how the rest of the file is laid out. When ZWNBS is used in this way, it's called a BOM - Byte Order Mark - and is not interpreted as the first character of a document.

UTF-32 is a very simple and transparent encoding - four bytes is one character, always, and one character is always four bytes - so it's often used as a way of processing Unicode data inside of a program. Many programming languages already allow you to read and write numbers that are four bytes long, so representing Unicode code points as numbers isn't a problem. (A "wide character", in languages such as C or Python, is a 32-bit wide data type, ideal for processing UTF-32 data.)
But UTF-32 is not very efficient. The first byte is always going to be zero, and the top seven bits of the second byte are going to be zero too. So UTF-32 is not often used as an on-disk storage format: we don't like the idea of spending nearly 50% of our disk space on bytes that are guaranteed to be empty.

So can we find a compromise where we use fewer bytes but still represent the majority of characters we're likely to use, in a relatively straightforward way? UTF-16 uses a group of 16 bits (2 bytes) instead of 32, on the basis that the first two bytes of UTF-32 are almost always unused. UTF-32 simply drops them, using two bytes to represent the Unicode characters from 0 to 65535, the characters within the Basic Multilingual Plane. This worked fine for the majority of characters that people were likely to use. (At least, before emoji inflicted themselves upon the world.) If you want to encode the Thai letter *to pa-tak* (‡∏è) which lives at code point 3599 in the Unicode standard, we write 3599 in binary: `0000111000001111` and get two bytes `0E 0F`.

But what if, as in the case of FATHER CHRISTMAS, we want to access code points above 65535? This is where the compromise comes in: to make it easy and efficient to represent characters in the BMP, UTF-16 gives up the ability to easily and efficiently represent characters outside. Instead, it uses a mechanism called *surrogate pairs* to encode a character from the supplementary planes. A surrogate pair is a 2-byte sequence that looks like it ought to be a valid Unicode character, but is actually from a reserved range which represents a move to another plane. So  UTF-16 uses 16 bits for a character inside the BMP, but two 16 bit sequences for those outside; in other words, UTF-16 is *generally* a fixed-width encoding, but in certain circumstances a character can be either two or four bytes.

Surrogate pairs work like this:

* First, subtract `0x010000` from the code point you want to encode. Now you have a 20 bit number.

* Split the 20 bit number into two 10 bit numbers. Add `0xD800` to the first, to give a number in the range `0xD800..0xDBFF`. Add `0xDC00` to the second, to give a number in the range `0xDC00..0xDFFF`. These are your two 16-bit code blocks.

So for FATHER CHRISTMAS, we start with codepoint 127877, which in hexadecimal is `0x1F385`.

* Take away `0x010000` to get `F385`, or `00001111001110000101`.

* Split this into `0000111100 1110000101` or `03C 385`.

* `0xD800` + `0x03C` = `D83C`

* `0xDC00` + `0x385` = `DF85`.

So FATHER CHRISTMAS in UTF-16 is `D8 3C DF 85`.

> Because most characters in use are in the BMP, and because the surrogate pairs *could* be interpreted as Unicode code points, some software may not bother to interpret surrogate pair processing. I suppose we should be grateful that emoji has forced programmers to be more aware of supplemental planes.

But UTF-16 still uses two bytes for ASCII and Western European Latin, which sadly are the only characters that any programmers actually care about. UTF-8 takes the trade-off introduced by UTF-16 a little further: characters in the ASCII set are represented as one bytes, just as they were originally in ASCII, while code points above 127 are represented using a variable number of bytes: codepoints from `0x80` to `0x7FF` are two bytes, from `0x800` to `0xffff` are three bytes, and higher characters are four bytes.

The conversion is best done by an existing computer program or library - you shouldn't have to do UTF-8 encoding by hand - but for reference, this is what you do. First, work out how many bytes the encoding is going to need, based on the Unicode code point. Then, convert the code point to binary, split it up and insert it into the pattern below, and pad with leading zeros:

|---
| Code point | Byte 1 | Byte 2 | Byte 3 | Byte 4 |
|-------|-------:|--------:|--------:|--------:|
|`0x00-0x7F`|`0xxxxxxx`|
|`0x80-0x7FF`|`110xxxxx`|`10xxxxxx`|
|`0x800-0xFFFF`|`1110xxxx`|`10xxxxxx`|`10xxxxxx`|
|`0x10000-0x10FFFF`|`11110xxx`|`10xxxxxx`|`10xxxxxx`|`10xxxxxx`|
|-------|-------|--------|--------|--------|

> Originally UTF-8 allowed sequences up to seven bytes long to encode characters all the way up to `0x7FFFFFFF`, but this was restricted when UTF-8 became an Internet standard to match the range of UTF-16. Once we need to encode more than a million characters in Unicode, UTF-8 will be insufficient. However, we are still some way away from that situation.

FATHER CHRISTMAS is going to take four bytes, because he is above `0x1000`. The binary representation of his codepoint 127877 is `11111001110000101`, so, inserting his bits into the pattern from the right, we get:

|---
||||
|-------|-------:|--------:|--------:|--------:|
|`0x1000-0x10FFFF`|`11110xxx`|`10x`**`11111`**|`10`**`001110`**|`10`**`000101`**|
|-------|-------|--------|--------|--------|

Finally, padding with zeros, we get:

|---
||||
|-------:|--------:|--------:|--------:|
|`11110`**`000`**|`10`**`011111`**|`10`**`001110`**|`10`**`000101`**|
|`F0`|`9F`|`8E`|`85`|
|-------|--------|--------|--------|

UTF-8 is not a bad trade-off. It's variable width, which means more work to process, but the benefit of that is efficiency - characters don't take up any more bytes than they need to. And the processing work is mitigated by the fact that the initial byte signals how long the byte sequence is. The leading bytes of the sequence also provide an unambiguous synchronisation point for processing software - if you don't recognise where you are inside a byte stream, just back up a maximum of four characters until you see a byte starting `0`, `110`, `1110` or `11110` and go from there.

Because of this, UTF-8 has become the *de facto* encoding standard of the Internet, with around 90% of web pages using it. If you have data that you're going to be shaping with an OpenType shaping engine, it's most likely going to begin in UTF-8 before being transformed to UTF-32 internally.
