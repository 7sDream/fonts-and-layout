title: A Brief History of Type
---

Once upon a time, a *font* was a bunch of pieces of metal. The first recorded use of metal type for printing is in 13th century China, with the first books being produced in Korea around the same time. Two hundred years later, Johannes Gutenberg came up with a system for creating metal type that would spread rapidly over Europe and continue to be the most common means of printing until the 19th century.

To create type for printing, engravers would work the images of letters, numbers and so on into molds called matrices. They would then use the molds to cast individual pieces of type (also known as sorts). A complete set of type sorts in the same size and style was collected together into a font.

Complete fonts of type would be placed into type cases, from which compositors would then select the sorts required to print a page and arrange them into lines and pages. Next, the printer would cover the face of the metal with ink and impress it onto the paper. With the advent of hot metal typesetting, which combined casting and compositing into one automated activity, the idea of a font of type fell out of fashion.

The idea was revived with the advent of digital typography. In 1964, the IBM 2260 Display Station provided one of the first text-based visual interfaces to a computer. The mainframe computer would generate the video signal and send it to the terminal, pixel by pixel: each character was 9 pixels wide and 14 pixels tall. The choice of bitmaps for each character was hard-wired into the mainframe, and could not be changed.
